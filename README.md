Banks incur significant financial losses when borrowers fail to repay their loans on time, which impacts overall financial stability and economic growth. In this problem, we aim to build a supervised machine learning classification model that can predict whether a customer is likely to default on their loan.

The dataset contains multiple financial and demographic attributes such as funded amount, loan balance, location, and repayment history. The training dataset consists of 67,463 rows and 35 columns, while the test dataset contains 28,913 rows and 34 columns, with the target variable being Loan Status.

The objective is to minimize log loss while ensuring the model generalizes well to unseen data
